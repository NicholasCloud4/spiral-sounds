      Challenge:
      1. Create a database and store its connection in a const 'db'.  
            The database will live in a file called 'database.db' which can be in root.
            The database driver will be 'sqlite3.Database'.
      2. Use the exec() method to write SQL to create a table called 'products'. It should have the following columns:
            id (unique key) 
            title (required, text)  
            artist (required, text) 
            price (required, floating-point number)
            image (required, text) (this is "text" because it will hold an image url)
            year (integer)
            genre (text)
            stock (integer)
      3. Close the database connection and log a message to say table created.
      
      When you are done, run createTable.js and then logTable.js to verify that it has worked.
